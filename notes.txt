ideas for project

    - ability to show multiple graphs on the screen at the same time

        -- oould be cool to do a masonry style moving around
        -- could summon as many graphs as we can fit to the screen
        -- would be able to drag and drop around the work area
            --- drag items off screen/to trash area to get rid of
        -- would be able to switch between types of graph, if applicable


    - could show area of best growth or whatever

    - could show areas for improvement


how to proceed?

    - make some block of html... angular directive... something

        -- that can be populated with a certain type of graph

        -- show more than one on screen

            --- would be great if I could get the code to automatically pull from a data source


        -- needs to definitely be scalable

        -- would be sweet if we could show different types of graphs..
            --- scroll through a databank of graph types
            --- selecting one would change all the types of graphs


        -- two views essentially, you select the graph type you want on one panel

        -- drag or otherwise mark for specific graph (eg: bar chart of miles ran) onto the other panel

        -- can view several side by side
